<h1>Movie Collection Application 0.0.1</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The Movie Collection App is a simple text-based user interface program that allows users to manage a collection of movies. 
It was developed as a project to understand how HashMaps work and to practice creating text-based user interaction, as well as writing proper documentation.
Note that the application does not include proper test classes, so bugs may occur.</p>

<h2>Main Functions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Adding a new movie to the collection</li>
  <li>Removing an existing movie from the collection</li>
  <li>Clearing the entire collection</li>
  <li>Retrieving details of an existing movie from the collection</li>
  <li>Retrieving a list of all movies in the collection</li>
  <li>Retrieving a list of movies by category in the collection</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the Application</h2>

<p>If you'd like to run the application, feel free to clone the repository to your own computer and run it in your preferred IDE.</p>

<p>Sincerely, Johannes</p>
